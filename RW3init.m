% RW3sim is trying to accomplish a realistic multi-axis reaction wheel 
% control. The situation I will try to simulate is when a reaction wheel is
% attached to the satallite's z- and x-axis.

% Definitions:
% The earth-centered-inertial frame is self-explanatory
% The orbit frame is the frame defined by the z-axis pointing towards the
% earth's center, and y-axis defined by the cross product of the satellite
% speed and earth-distance vector. 
% The body frame is the frame that is rigidly attached to the cube-sat
% The desired frame is the frame symoling the wanted satellite attitude
% The reaction wheel frame is the frame showing the RW orientations ins
% respect to the body frame

% Physical constants are extracted from the paper: 
% Spacecraft Attitude and Angular Rate Tracking using Reaction Wheels and
% Magnetorquers


%% Reaction wheels
% Note to self: RW mass is not necessary for a true spacecraft attitude 
% physics simulation. This is because a torque applied to the RWs will also
% apply the oppsite torque on the spacecraft. However, the RW masses are 
% necessary for determening the RW rotational speed and angular momentum.
